# Code Refactor for Semantic Rules & Web Accessibility Standards

## Description

Horiseon's website follows a simple website design using a single HTML page and external css file (located in the assets folder). The original website design and code was provided, which I then modified to improve SEO (search engine optimization) by meeting website accessibility standards and HTML semantic rules. First, I changed the non-semantic elements (elements with no indication of its content to the browser), such as <div> and <span> to semantic elements (that more clearly define its content to the browser), such as <header>, <nav>, <content>, <aside>, <section>, <footer>. This also Second, I added proper alternative text for images by adding alt atributes to all image tags in order to follow web accessibility standards. Third, I changed the title element to have a concise, descriptive title. Fourth, I condensed the css style sheet code by converting redundant classes which had the same attributes to one class. Lastly, for formatting purposes, I Added clearfix class so that any child elements with floats wouldn't overflow outside of its parent element.
